# drone-delivery-algorithm
This project seeks to minimize the number of drones needed to deliver multiple packages to different locations by considering the weights of the packages as well as various environmental factors and their effects on the dronesâ€™ battery consumption rate and time efficiency of the deliveries. We derive mathematical relationships between factors such as temperature, wind resistance, ground elevation height and the battery consumption rate of the drones. These relationships can then be used to calculate the time difference and success probability of a single drone delivering multiple packages to a series of locations as opposed to multiple ones. By pooling package delivery resources as such, the overall cost of deliveries is minimized.
